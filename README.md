# Pokemon-Visualizer
This is a simple free Unity tool to help visualize Pokémon stats, weaknesses, and moves I made for an essay I am writing.

The data for this project is from the following repository: https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json, 
which contains data from Bulbapedia.

All the work for gathering the data and creating the utilized jsons goes to the contributors to that repository.

All included Pokemon designs, images, etc. are copyrighted by the Pokémon Company and its affiliates.

A built, usable version of this project may be found <a href = "https://purpleml.itch.io/pokevisualizer">here</a>
