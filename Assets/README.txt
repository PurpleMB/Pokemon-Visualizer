This is a simple tool to help visualize Pokémon stats, weaknesses, and moves I made for an essay I am writing.

The data for this project is from the following repository: https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json

All the work for gathering the data and creating the utilized jsons goes to the contributors to that repository, and of course
all images, designs, etc. regarding Pokémon are copyright property of The Pokémon Company and its affiliates.
